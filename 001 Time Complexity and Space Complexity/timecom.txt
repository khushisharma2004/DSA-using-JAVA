Time Complexity — Short Note

Time complexity measures how the runtime of an algorithm grows with input size n. It is expressed using Big-O notation and focuses on the dominant term (ignore constants and lower-order terms).

Common complexities:
- O(1): constant time
- O(log n): logarithmic time
- O(n): linear time
- O(n log n): linearithmic time
- O(n^2): quadratic time
- O(2^n), O(n!): exponential/factorial time (very expensive)

Tips:
- Count the number of basic operations as a function of n.
- Prefer worst-case analysis unless average/best-case is required.
- Use divide-and-conquer and pruning to reduce complexity when possible.
